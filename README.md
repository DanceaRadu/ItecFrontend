# ItecFrontend

The Angular powered frontend for the Itec 2024 hackathon. In this edition of Itec, we had to develop an application from which you could monitor the UP status and response time of other applications.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
